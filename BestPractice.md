## Best Practices for Entertainment App Development

1. **Modular Architecture**: Break down the application into smaller, reusable modules to promote maintainability and scalability. Use components or modules for the frontend and separate services or modules for the backend.

2. **Code Comments and Documentation**: Document your code thoroughly with comments and documentation to improve readability and understanding.

3. **Consistent Code Style and Formatting**: Follow consistent coding styles and formatting conventions across the project.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.

5. **Data Validation and Sanitization**: Validate and sanitize user input to prevent security vulnerabilities.

6. **Security Practices**: Implement security best practices such as using HTTPS, securing sensitive data, and enforcing strong password policies.

7. **Optimized Performance**: Optimize the performance of your application by minimizing network requests, reducing bundle sizes, and implementing caching strategies.

8. **Middleware**: The authenticateJWT middleware is employed to safeguard routes necessitating user authentication, ensuring that solely authorized requests gain access to sensitive endpoints.

9. **Projection in Database Queries**: The projection feature in MongoDB is employed during database queries to restrict the fields included in the response, which enhances query efficiency and reduces network bandwidth consumption.

10. **Sepration using dot**: Used seperation using dot for controllers, routes, and models to enhance the parrticular use. For example for movies controller movies.controller.js is used while for routes movies.routes.js is used.
